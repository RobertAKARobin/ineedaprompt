============
INeedAPrompt.com has a dictionary of 500-ish words and phrases, and generates a writing or drawing prompt from those.

This is the first thing I've put on GitHub and the first code I've made public. I have no idea what I'm doing.

All of the interesting stuff is in index.php. dictionary.php is my hacked-together-in-2-minutes dashboard for adding and removing words to and from the dictionary.
