============
www.INeedAPrompt.com has a dictionary of 500-ish words and phrases, and generates a writing or drawing prompt from those.

The most difficult bit was figuring out how to make the prompts grammatically correct. Getting the script to add Oxford commas was a blast.

All of the interesting stuff is in index.php. dictionary.php is my hacked-together-in-2-minutes dashboard for adding and removing words to and from the dictionary.

In conclusion, this is the first thing I've put on GitHub and the first code I've made public, and I have no idea what I'm doing.
