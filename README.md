hello@robertakarobin.com

www.INeedAPrompt.com has a dictionary of 500-ish words and phrases, and generates a writing or drawing prompt from those.

The most difficult bit was figuring out how to make the prompts grammatically correct. Getting the script to add Oxford commas was a blast.

All of the interesting stuff is in index.php. dictionary.php is my hacked-together-in-2-minutes dashboard for adding and removing words to and from the dictionary.

This is the first thing I've put on GitHub and the first code I've made public.

To do:

Have browsers with Javascript enabled cache the dictionary so new prompts can be generated without having to reload the whole page
